  dialogue:
  - Stay back fiend, I have slayed many lost bones with my shovel before you.
  - Wait, you TALK.  They have never talked before.  Something is different about
    you.  Why are you here?
  - Well this is unexpected.  I suppose I could use a hand. You see there are four
    graveyard plots.  There is the one here that we are at, and then there are three
    others.  The other plots, however, have been overrun with undead forces.  If
    you could clear those other plots out it would allow me to bury people with their
    families again.
  - Thank you now get going!
  - Oh thank you so much.  The people of the town will be so happy that they can
    visit their deceased again.  You have done a great service for us.
  - That is where the final king of Akahatii, King Kinree is buried.  Well buried
    is a bit of an overstatement, no one was ever able to recover his body.  All
    that was left was his crown, you can go see it.
  playerDialogue:
  - Whoa there.  It's ok I'm on your side.
  - If you think you could kill me with a shovel you got another thing coming.
  - I was sent to help.  I'm working with the town, they said that you could use
    some help purifying the Graveyard.
  - Oh look, the old guys got a brain.  Why do you think I'm here? I'm here to help
    you
  - Of course, my shield is yours.
  - Yea yea kill things got it
  - It was my honor to serve you. Before I go do you know anything about that large
    tomb.
  - And you can pay me by telling me what that large tomb is for.
