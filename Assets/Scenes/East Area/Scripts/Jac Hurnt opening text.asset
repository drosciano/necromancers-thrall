  dialogue:
  - You came to the wrong part of town, dry bones
  - Wait, you're not one of them. Gonna be honest never thought I would see a dry
    bones helping us
  - Well if you are truly here to help I might have something for you. You see this
    valley, well believe it or not it used to have a beautiful river running through
    it before Livernis dried the whole area up. Now, all we have is this pathetic
    desert.
  - "Well supposedly the heart of the river lies at the end of this maze. Livernis
    created the maze so that we couldn\u2019t release the river again. If you take
    to long getting through the maze then you\u2019re dead meat\u2026 dead bone in
    your case. However, if you could get to the end of the maze and release the river
    again I would be eternally grateful."
  - "Thank you so much I know it\u2019s a lot to ask, but for some reason I trust
    you. If anyone can do this you can. "
  playerDialogue:
  - "Wait I\u2019m here to help"
  - Why does everyone want to kill me
  - "It\u2019s a long story, but I am on your side"
  - "Just because I\u2019m a skeleton doesn\u2019t mean I'm evil, gosh everyone here
    is so boneist"
  - So what is it you would have me do?
  - Okay buddy, let's get to the point
  - "I\u2019ll see what I can do"
  - "Got it you want me to risk my life for\u2026 water."
